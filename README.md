# Traveling Salesman Problem

Project description in the projectReport.pdf file

TSP as points in a two-dimensional plane

Implemented algorithms:
* genetic algorithm (with two types of gene_space values: 1. gene_space $\in$ [0, 1]; 2. gene_space = (0, 1, ..., len(nodes))
* ant colony optimization
* metaheuristic method (simulated annealing)

Used python packages:
* pyGAD
* pANTS
* python-tsp
